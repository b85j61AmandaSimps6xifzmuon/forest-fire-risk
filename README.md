# ConfidentialForestFireRisk

ConfidentialForestFireRisk is a privacy-preserving forest fire risk prediction platform. It leverages encrypted meteorological data, satellite vegetation information, and historical fire records to predict high-risk areas, providing actionable insights for forest management and disaster prevention. The system ensures that sensitive environmental and regional data remain confidential while enabling advanced risk modeling.

## Project Background

Forest fires are a critical environmental threat, causing economic damage, ecological loss, and human safety hazards. Traditional risk prediction methods often require centralized access to sensitive environmental data, raising several challenges:

* **Data Sensitivity:** Meteorological stations and satellite providers may not want raw data exposed.
* **Privacy Concerns:** Historical incident data may contain sensitive location information.
* **Limited Collaboration:** Sharing raw datasets across agencies or regions is often restricted.
* **Inaccurate Aggregation:** Combining heterogeneous datasets without proper privacy safeguards is difficult.

ConfidentialForestFireRisk addresses these challenges using Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing risk computations directly on encrypted data without revealing raw values. Agencies can collaborate and model risks while preserving the confidentiality of their datasets.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

* **Encrypted Multi-source Data Integration:** Combines meteorological readings, satellite vegetation indices, and historical fire events in a fully encrypted pipeline.
* **FHE-based Risk Modeling:** Calculates fire probability scores over encrypted inputs, ensuring raw data remains private.
* **High-risk Zone Identification:** Generates secure risk maps highlighting regions susceptible to fire outbreaks.
* **Resource Planning Assistance:** Suggests optimized deployment for firefighting resources without exposing sensitive regional data.

### Privacy & Security

* **Client-side Encryption:** All data is encrypted before it leaves the source.
* **Secure Computation:** Fire risk predictions are performed on encrypted datasets using FHE.
* **Immutable Results:** Predictions and risk maps can be stored securely without exposing underlying data.
* **Collaborative Confidential Analysis:** Multiple agencies can jointly contribute to modeling without sharing raw inputs.

### Visualization

* **Interactive Risk Maps:** GIS-based maps visualize encrypted predictions for decision-makers.
* **Dynamic Layers:** Overlay historical fire occurrences, vegetation indexes, and weather anomalies.
* **Heatmaps & Probability Scores:** Easy-to-interpret visual representation of high-risk zones.

## Architecture

### Encrypted Data Layer

* Handles ingestion of heterogeneous datasets.
* Performs client-side encryption before storage or computation.
* Supports incremental updates from multiple sources without exposing raw data.

### FHE Computation Layer

* Implements fire risk prediction models directly on encrypted inputs.
* Supports linear and non-linear risk factors including weather, vegetation, and past fires.
* Outputs encrypted risk scores that can be decrypted only by authorized entities.

### Mapping & Dashboard

* GIS-enabled frontend to visualize risk maps and dynamic statistics.
* Interactive dashboards to explore high-risk areas and resource allocation suggestions.
* Secure access controls ensuring only decrypted views are shown to authorized users.

## Technology Stack

* **Concrete ML:** For implementing homomorphic encryption-compatible machine learning models.
* **Python:** Data preprocessing, modeling, and FHE computation orchestration.
* **GIS Tools:** Visualization of risk maps and spatial data analysis.
* **Encrypted Storage:** Secure storage for multi-source encrypted datasets.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Required Python libraries for FHE and GIS processing
* Sufficient system resources for encrypted computation and model inference

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd forest-fire-risk
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Prediction Pipeline

```bash
python preprocess_data.py     # Encrypt and merge datasets
python predict_risk.py        # Execute FHE-based risk prediction
python generate_map.py        # Produce encrypted risk maps
```

## Security Features

* **Full Homomorphic Encryption:** All computations are performed on encrypted datasets.
* **Data Minimization:** No raw sensitive data is ever shared or stored centrally.
* **Auditability:** Decrypted results can be verified against encrypted inputs for integrity.
* **Access Control:** Only authorized parties can decrypt final risk predictions and maps.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data:** Gather meteorological, satellite, and historical fire datasets.
2. **Encrypt Data:** Ensure all datasets are encrypted prior to analysis.
3. **Run Predictions:** Execute FHE-based models to generate risk scores.
4. **Visualize Results:** Explore GIS maps and heatmaps for high-risk forest areas.
5. **Deploy Resources:** Use secure predictions to guide firefighting and prevention strategies.

## Future Roadmap
